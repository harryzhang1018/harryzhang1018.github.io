My name is Harry (Haorui) Zhang and I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics, and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I’m also currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering. My research at the Simulation Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) focuses on developing autonomy stacks for various purposes, e.g. path-following and obstacle avoidance, utilizing advanced simulation-to-reality transfer methodologies.</p> </body></html>
